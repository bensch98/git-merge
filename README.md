# Git Merger

As many developers have to use a separate git account during work, a large amount of their work is not tracked in their personal profile which is often a good reference on resumes etc.
GitMerger solves this problem by importing meta data of your work commits to a dummy repo in your private Git account.


## Installation

Easiest way:
```bash
pip install git-merger
```

Or you can also install it from source.

If you have nice ideas, feel free to open a PR.


## Usage

The preferred way to use this is via the command line tool.
However you could also use the package itself and experiment with it.
